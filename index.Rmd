<!-- From gitbook to pdf:

for pdf: bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_book") 
for gitbook: bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::gitbook")

From html to pdf 4 things change:
  1. uncomment last figure from knitr chunk to latex format in chapter 03.
  3. uncomment emphbox in 04.
  4. Set pdf <- TRUE to hide code chunk output and adjust kable formating in Appendix

```{r setup, echo = F}
pdf <- FALSE
# Set code chunk output globally 
if (pdf) knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)

# Introduction {-}

This brochure aims at illustrating the of the collaboration between INE Chile and PARIS21 which took place from September to December 2022. It was initiated thanks to the [Data Science Accelerator program](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/capability/international/international-data-science-accelerator-programme/what-is-the-international-data-science-accelerator-programme/) organized by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) of the United Kingdom. We are greatful for all the work that was put in by Nicolas Eduardo Guarda Hinostroza (INE Chile), Yu Tian (PARIS21) and Johannes Abele (PARIS21).
