<!-- From gitbook to pdf:

for pdf: bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_book") 
for gitbook: bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::gitbook")

From html to pdf 4 things change:
  1. uncomment last figure from knitr chunk to latex format in chapter 03.
  3. uncomment emphbox in 04.
  4. Set pdf <- TRUE to hide code chunk output and adjust kable formating in Appendix
-->

```{r setup, echo = F}
pdf <- FALSE
# Set code chunk output globally 
if (pdf) knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)
```
